1) What is the difference between a client and a server? In the HTTP protocol,
which one of these sends requests, and which one sends responses?

The client, usually the browser or personal computer, sends web requests. This is the front-end of a web application.
The server, a machine, waits and listens for web requests and sends a response (usually HTML). This is the back-end of a web application.

-------------------
2) What do we mean by a "route" on a server?

A route on a server is the communication path between the client. It receives various HTTP requests (ex. GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), calls a function to handle the request, and directs it to the specified url endpoint.

3) The steps below de describe what happens when a user goes to
a URL like https://facebook.com/home in their browser, but are out of order.
Put them in the correct order from start to finish.

- The server runs a function associated to the route /home, which produces some HTML
- The user's browser displays the HTML it recieved
- The server sends that HTML back to the user's browser as a response
- The user's browser sends a request to a Facebook server for the route /home
- The User types in https://facebook.com/home and hits enter

1 - The User types in https://facebook.com/home and hits enter
2 - The user's browser sends a request to a Facebook server for the route /home
3 - The server runs a function associated to the route /home, which produces some HTML
4 - The server sends that HTML back to the user's browser as a response
5 - The user's browser displays the HTML it received
